# garland
A garland word is one that starts and ends with the same N letters in the same order, for some N greater than 0, but less than the length of the word. I'll call the maximum N for which this works the garland word's degree. A function garland that, given a lowercase word, returns the degree of the word if it's a garland word, and 0 otherwise.
